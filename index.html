            <h2>Mother of Dragons</h2>
            <br>
            
            <p>
                Introduced in 1996's A Game of Thrones, Daenerys is one of the last surviving members (along with her older brother,
                Viserys) of House Targaryen which, until 14 years before the events of the first novel, had ruled Westeros from the Iron
                Throne for nearly 300 years before being ousted. She subsequently appeared in A Clash of Kings (1998) and A Storm of
                Swords (2000). Daenerys was one of a few prominent characters not included in 2005's A Feast for Crows, but returned in
                the next novel A Dance with Dragons (2011).

                In the story, Daenerys is in her early teens living in exile in Essos. She remains dependent on her abusive older
                brother, Viserys, and is forced to marry Dothraki horselord Khal Drogo in exchange for an army for Viserys, who wishes
                to return to Westeros and recapture the Iron Throne. Daenerys adapts to life with the Dothraki, and her character
                emerges as strong, confident and courageous. She becomes the heir of the Targaryen dynasty after her brother's murder
                and plans to reclaim the Iron Throne herself, seeing it as her birthright. A pregnant Daenerys loses her husband and
                child, but soon helps to hatch three dragons from their eggs. The dragons provide her with a tactical advantage and
                prestige. She also acquires an army of former slave soldiers with which she conquers the cities of Yunkai, Astapor and
                Meereen, determined to end slavery and injustice. Despite her strong moral compass, she can deal ruthlessly with her
                enemies, particularly slave masters. She establishes herself as a powerful and relentless ruler.

                Daenerys is most often described as uncommonly beautiful, with long, pale silver-gold hair and purple eyes. She
                is slender and pale, although taller than some of her female ancestors. Tales of Daenerys's beauty are numerous, and
                throughout the novels she encounters countless suitors who seek her hand in marriage, sometimes to gain control of her
                three dragons. She is fluent in the Common Tongue of Westeros, Dothraki, High Valyrian and bastard Valyrian, which she
                speaks with a Tyroshi accent. Over the course of the first three novels she becomes fluent in the Dothraki language
                and Ghiscari, spoken in the slave cities in Essos.
